# LVPSegNet and LGE-LVP dataset for segmentation of the LV and its pathologies for AMI after reperfusion in LGE-CMR Images 
This repository is the official pytorch implementation of the proposed LVPSegNet in paper "Segmentation of the Left Ventricle and Its Pathologies for Acute Myocardial Infarction After Reperfusion in LGE-CMR Images" in IEEE TMI 2025.

# Overview

Due to the association with higher incidence of left ventricular dysfunction and complications, segmentation of left ventricle and related pathological tissues: microvascular obstruction and myocardial infarction from Late gadolinium enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance images is crucially important. However, lack of datasets, diverse shapes and locations, extreme imbalanced class, severe intensity distribution overlapping are the main challenges. We first release a Late gadolinium enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance benchmark dataset LGE-LVP containing 140 patients with left ventricle myocardial infarction and concomitant microvascular obstruction. Then, a progressive deep learning model LVPSegNet is proposed to segment the left ventricle and its pathologies via adaptive region of interest extraction, task-specific sample augmentation, curriculum learning, and intra- and inter-receptive interactions mechanisms in dealing with the challenges. Comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art models on the internal (LGE-LVP) and external datasets demonstrate that the proposed model performs the best on both geometric and clinical metrics and it closely matched the clinicianâ€™s performance. Overall, the released LGE-LVP dataset alongside the proposed LVPSegNet offer a practical solution for automated left ventricular and its pathologies segmentation by providing data support and facilitating effective segmentation.
